It offers three priority queue message pipelines for you to choose from:</p><ul><li><code>Memory Priority Mode</code>: No message queue service required, suitable for local development or scenarios that don&#39;t need distributed scraping.</li><li><code>RabbitMq Mode</code>: Uses <code>RabbitMq</code> as the priority queue for distributed collaborative scraping, improving scraping efficiency.</li><li><code>Redis Queue Mode</code>: Uses <code>Redis</code> as the priority queue, which is similar to <code>RabbitMq</code> and suitable for different queue usage scenarios.</li></ul><p>It also provides many built-in features, allowing you to focus more on the web scraping logic itself. This makes your development code cleaner, reduces repetitive work, and makes the scraping code more standardized and easier to maintain.</p><p>Additionally, its concurrency features can also assist with some data processing tasks.</p><hr><h3 id="pacer-asynchronous-backend-framework" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pacer-asynchronous-backend-framework"><span><mark>Pacer</mark> Asynchronous Backend Framework</span></a></h3>',6)),r(t,{repo:"YSH0313/pacer",items:"stars,version,dm,license,source"}),e[2]||(e[2]=a('<p><a href="https://github.com/YSH0313/pacer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Pacer</code></a> It is a complete asynchronous backend framework designed specifically for <code>Python</code> engineers.
